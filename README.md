## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1.  **API Keys:** You need to obtain free API keys from:
    *   [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
    *   [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)
2.  **Local Server:** Since this project uses ES6 Modules (`import`/`export`), you cannot simply double-click `index.html`. You must serve it via a local server (e.g., VS Code "Live Server" extension).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/localpulse.git
    cd localpulse
    ```

2.  **Configure API Keys**
    The `js/config.js` file handles your API credentials.
    *   If the file exists, open it.
    *   If not, create `js/config.js` and add the following:

    ```javascript
    // js/config.js
    export const WEATHER_API_KEY = "YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY_HERE"; 
    export const WEATHER_BASE_URL = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast";

    export const NEWS_API_KEY = "YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY_HERE"; 
    export const NEWS_BASE_URL = "https://newsapi.org/v2/everything";
    ```

3.  **Run the App**
    *   **VS Code:** Right-click `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**.
      
## 🔒 Security Note

**Do not commit your real API keys to GitHub.**
Ensure your `.gitignore` file includes `config.js` if you plan to make this repo public.

```text
# .gitignore
js/config.js
```
## 📸 Usage

*   **Landing Page:** You are greeted with a clean search interface and a cityscape illustration.
*   **Search:** Enter a city name (e.g., "Kolkata", "New Delhi") and hit **Enter** or click **Search**.
*   **Results:** The UI transitions. The cityscape fades out, and cards for Weather and News slide in.
*   **Navigation:** Click "Home" (or the logo) to reset the view. Click "Services" or "About" to view the modal overlays.
